### His is my password generator, a console project. I decided to create it to test my logic in C#.

<h2>Features included</h2>

* Set the password length.
* Choose if the password will include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* Generate secure passwords.
* Shuffle the password characters.

<h2>Technologies used:</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>C#</td>
    <td>.NET CORE</td>
    <td>StringBuilder</td>
    <td>Random</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h2>Future improvements I consider for the password generator:</h2>

+ Implement encryption.
+ Create a GUI to enhance the user experience.
+ Add a strength meter to evaluate the generated password.
+ Allow more control over the types of characters or patterns used in the generation.
